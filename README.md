# AI VideoSlide Creator

**AI VideoSlide Creator** is a Python-based script that allows you to create video slides using images. The script requires certain dependencies and configurations to be set up in order to work smoothly. Follow the instructions below to install and set it up.

## Requirements

- **Python** (Ensure you have Python installed)
- **Google Chrome** (Used for web scraping or image downloading)
- **ChromeDriver** (For Chrome WebDriver to interact with the browser)

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium moviepy pillow requests
```

### Step 2: Configure ChromeDriver

You need to configure ChromeDriver to enable the script to interact with the Chrome browser. 

1. **Download ChromeDriver**:  
   Ensure that you have the ChromeDriver executable compatible with your version of Chrome. You can download it from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/).

2. **Edit the ChromeDriver Path**:  
   Open the `image_download.py` file in your project directory. Look for the following section of the code:

   ```python
   # ChromeDriver setup
   driver_path = r"C:\chromedriver-win64\chromedriver.exe"
   service = Service(driver_path)
   chrome_options = Options()
   chrome_options.add_argument("--log-level=3")  # Suppress console logs
   ```

   Update the `driver_path` variable to match the location of your `chromedriver.exe` file.

   Example (for Windows):

   ```python
   driver_path = r"C:\path\to\your\chromedriver.exe"
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Script

Once you’ve configured ChromeDriver, run the `aivideo_create.py` script to generate your video slides.

```bash
python aivideo_create.py
```

Enjoy creating your AI-powered video slides!
